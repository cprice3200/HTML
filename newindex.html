  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello.  My name is Carrie Price.  I am the 
    librarian at Fairview Elementary School 
    and Fairview Middle & High School in 
    Ashland, Kentucky.  The 2023-24 school year
     marked my 25th year of teaching and I 
    absolutely love my school district and all
     my students.  
    </p>

    <p>I have been married to my wonderful 
        husband, Tim for 21 years and have two 
        amazing children- Graycin & Brycen.  
        My daughter, Graycin, just turned 19 
        and just completed her first year of college. 
        My son, Brycen, just completed his first year of middle school.  Our family stays extremely busy with year-round sports & coaching, but I wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our spare time, we love to camp.  It is extremely relaxing and a nice change of pace.  We also love to travel- anywhere with a beach is an ideal vacation for me! I love both activities because they equal more family time, which means the world to me! 
             </p>
    <p>Being a librarian has always been a goal of mine. After completing one additional class this fall, I will receive a Rank 1 in Library Science through Eastern Kentucky University.</p>
