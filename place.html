    <h1>Where is my favorite place?</h1>
<p>Crashing waves, salty breeze, warm sand and my new book, It Ends With Us, in my hand is describes my perfect place. It is located in Surfside Beach, South Carolina. The weather is almost always beautiful and the beach is buttery soft to the touch. The sun rises on an almost secluded beach, except for a few dolphins and seagulls catching their breakfast.</p>
<p>After a full day of sun and swimming, it is time to get ready and head to dinner at one of the many beachfront restaurants. My family loves to go to River Cities Cafe and watch the beautiful ocean sunset while enjoying a nice meal.</p>
<p>A relaxing walk on the beach or maybe a golf cart ride through the local streets makes for a perfect night. Surfside Beach really is  My Perfect Place! </p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
