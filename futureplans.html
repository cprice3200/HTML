    <h1>My Future Plans</h1>
    <h3>My Educational Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete my Rank 1</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I will finish my degree by completing my final class this Fall.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Become a College/University Professor</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This has always been a goal that I have set for myself.  After completing my Rank 1, there are many areas that I will be qualified to teach.  I would like an adjunct position so that I can continue my library career as well.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Personal Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Open a Small Business</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I have always wanted to open a small boutique business.  I would love the traditional brick and mortar storefront, but would settle for online sales at first.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Own a Beach Villa</li>
        <ul>
            <li>As I get closer to retirement, this is a definite goal.  I would love to spend my summers at the beach with my family.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
